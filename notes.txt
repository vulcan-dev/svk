// DONE: (Minor) In DrawFrame and RecordCommandBuffer, take in `svkEngine*`.
// DONE: (Major) Instead of drawing all the objects in the RecordCommandBuffer function, create a function
//               here and have it call it, so: "svkScene_Render(svke)". We can then figure out what to batch render
//               and have it be cleaner to look at. We also need to reset the model identity after each call.

// TODO: (Major) Implement depth buffering, shouldn't be too difficult.
// TODO: (Major) Finish implementing the camera structure, if we resize then the new view will be handled in "svkScene_Render".
// TODO: (Major) Meshing and batched rendering. Right now, I'm just iterating through the drawables and issuing a `vkCmdDraw` for each of them.
